# Super Market 🛒💹


This is a Simple Supermarket Application . It is a beginner-friendly C++ project designed at my freshman year in computer science. The program allows the user to add items to a shopping cart, calculate the total cost of the items, and process the payment. The program also includes error handling to prevent invalid input or insufficient funds during the payment process.❤️
